The most important and useful components of the library are the following:
* Local storage - persistence of data downloaded from Evernote service in a local SQLite database
* Synchronization - the logics of exchanging new and/or modified data with Evernote service
* Note editor - the UI component capable for notes displaying and editing

The library is based on the lower level functionality provided by [QEverCloud](https://github.com/d1vanov/QEverCloud) library.
